# fish irc bot #

A simple IRC bot framework written in [fish](http://fishshell.com/) and heavily influenced by [bash-irc-bot](https://github.com/Newbrict/bash-irc-bot).

**Note: This is not under active development. It has been superceded by https://github.com/scott-linder/irsh and is now just an archive of an old version of that bot.**
